Grid layout system for CSS which is similar to Flex
Difference between Flex and Grid is, Grid is capable fo two dimensional layouts
CSS Grid is bit difficult to use than Flex but it is more powerful
Can use "align-items", "justify-content" etc
Partial support for IE11



display: grid (Create a "grid")
All direct child elements are "grid items"
"grid-template-columns" defines width and number of cols
FR unit(fraction)


The biggest difference between Flex and Grid is that Grid is capable of two dimensional while FLex supports only for single dimension

Grid vs Flex
1.  It is Not one or the other
2.  Use CSS Grid for outter elements and grid-like layouts
3.  Use Flex for sumple alignment(Inner elements, menu items, etc)
4.  Most of the stuff we have done so far, I would use flex
